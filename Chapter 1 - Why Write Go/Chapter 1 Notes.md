# Why Write Go?

## Speed Demon?

### Go is executes faster than...

- JS
- Python
- Ruby
- PHP

### Go compiles faster than...

- Rust
- C
- C++
- Java
- C#

## Interpreted vs VM vs Compiled

### From Slowest to Fastest (By Category)

- Interpreted

  - Python
  - Ruby
  - PHP
  - JS

- VM

  - Java
  - C#

- Compiled

  - Go
  - Rust
  - C
  - C++

- Go is a compiled language, but its runtime speed is more comparable to languages like Java and C#
- However, Go tends to use much less memory than Java and C#
  - because there isnt a need for a VM
- The primary reason for this?
  - the Go runtime

### What is the Go runtime?

- The Go runtime manages memory allocation and garbage collection
